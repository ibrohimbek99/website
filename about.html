                <p class="paragraph">Uzbekistan is a wonderful country in the Central Asia, located at the crossroads of ancient civilizations. A numerous amount of famous personalities considered the region as the Pearl of the East and desired to include it to their empire: Persians, Greeks led by Alexander the Great, Arabs, Genghiz Khan with his Mongols and etc. During Medieval, cities like Bukhara and Samarkand became the Dome of Islam and Muslim culture, providing uncountable number of scholars and philosophers: Al-Khwarazmi(Algorithmi) the father of Algebra, Abu Ali ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al Farghani (Alfraganus) astronomer and many more. Uzbekistan got it independence from Soviet Union in 1991, and since then it has been developing at a fast pace. The Government focused on the education of the younger generation, "the children of the Independence", because everybody believes that they are the future of Uzbekistan. And me, as a son of my country will do my best to contribute to the image of Uzbekistan on the world arena.

                <h2>Why UIndy?</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                <p class="paragraph">UIndy was not my first option, since I was accepted by a lot of universities arount the US. However, UIndy seemed to be a great choice, since the University is private and the class size is small, which makes the learning process more effective. On top of that my parents thought it is going to be wise from financial standpoint, since the University offered me a decent scholarship.
