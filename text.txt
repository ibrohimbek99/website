My name is Ibrokhimbek Pulatov, but I go by Ibra. I am junior student double majoring in Computer Science and Business Management. I am international Student from Uzbekistan, the heart of the Central Asia. I came from culturally diverse environment, which really helped me to adapt quickly in the US and make as much connections as I can. 

A little bit about Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan is a wonderful country in the Central Asia, located at the crossroads of ancient civilizations. A numerous amount of famous personalities considered the region as the Pearl of the East and desired to include it to their empire: Persians, Greeks led by Alexander the Great, Arabs, Genghiz Khan with his Mongols and etc. During Medieval, cities like Bukhara and Samarkand became the Dome of Islam and Muslim culture, providing uncountable number of scholars and philosophers: Al-Khwarazmi(Algorithmi) the father of Algebra, Abu Ali ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al Farghani (Alfraganus) astronomer and many more. Uzbekistan got it independence from Soviet Union in 1991, and since then it has been developing at a fast pace. The Government focused on the education of the younger generation, "the children of the Independence", because everybody believes that they are the future of Uzbekistan. And me, as a son of my country will do my best to contribute to the image of Uzbekistan on the world arena.
